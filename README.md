## Wyatt Kinkade Personal/Professional Repositiory

I'll likely include links to repositories that I maintain that are public both for examples and to share that others might be able to use them for their own needs.

Given that I am primarily not a programmer, most of what I have is either

1. Bash/Python Scripts for general use, these likely will be fairly generic and fill some really general roles, honestly I intend to share these mostly because I can pull them down with wget for automated linux installations.

Examples:
- https://github.com/wyatt-kinkade/CDPPi
- https://github.com/wyatt-kinkade/public-personal-repos

2. Ansible Playbooks for networking, in theory primarily for Cisco ASA and IOS, but honestly I'll also likely have a good amount of Windows, Linux, and VMWare in here I don't know what I will share and what I won't given that I expect to need to sanitize anything I use in my personal environment.

Examples:
